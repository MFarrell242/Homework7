# Homework7
this is a script which will, when asked, generate a profile page of sorts using the user's github and favorite color. Inquirer gets the answers, then axios makes the call, then a new node module called PDFKit generates a one-page .PDF containing relevant information from the user's github api response; formatted over text cards which are generated as the user's declared favorite color. Program works as expected, however I haven't quite pinned down how to order the script to download the profile picture from the link given by github's api. If I had the picture locally, I believe the commented-out line would place it appropriately, however.
